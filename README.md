PyTour
======

An in-browser tour of Python. Suitable for new students, teachers, presenters, etc.

To use, just run server.py, then open up a browser and navigate to the given URL. You're off and running!

To make a tarball to distribute to students, use the maketar.sh script. When presenting using this approach, I usually have everyone download the tarball, unpack it, and run it on their own laptops. Then we are all looking at the same thing. I collapse the slide text and just show the code window on the presentation device so that everyone can see it.
