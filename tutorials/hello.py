"""Hello, Python!

Welcome to Python, a very fun language to use and
learn!

Here we have a simple "Hello World!" program. All
you have to do is print, and you have output. Try
running it now, either by clicking *Run*, or
pressing *Shift-Enter*.

Python starts at the top of your program and does
what you tell it to until it reaches the bottom.
Here, we have told it to **print** a **string**
(text surrounded by quotation marks) to the output
window, and it has.

Once you've tried out some exercises, navigate to
other slides using the navigation arrows or
the *Page-Up* and *Page-Down* keys.

Exercises

- Try removing each of the quotation marks in
  turn. What happens?

- Change the string to say hello specifically to you.

- Print 'Hello, Python!' using two strings instead
  of one, like this: |print 'Hello', 'Python!'|.
  What did |print| do for you automatically?
"""

print 'Hello, Python!'
